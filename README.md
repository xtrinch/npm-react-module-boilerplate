Boilerplate for developing ReactJS modules using Babel.

## Commands
- `npm start` - start webpack-dev-server for module development. You can open `examples/index.html` and customize `examples/index.js` to test your code. Webpack config resides in `examples/webpack.config.js`. Server will run on localhost:8080

- `npm run lint` - lint your code

- `npm run build` - build `/lib` folder

- `npm publish` - publish your package to npmjs.com. Remember to customize `package.json` to suit your custom module.
